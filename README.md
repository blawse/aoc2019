# Advent of Code 2019
Advent of Code 2019 solutions (if I have time)

I wanted to have each puzzle read the input from the website, but the authentication determines your input values, so for now you just have to copy your input into the source file for that day. Should be pretty simple to replace the values that are there (which were from my login).

So far, running `npm install` is not required, but I expect at some point to likely use libraries.

To run a day's challenge, just use:

```
node day1.js
```

Each day will be done in its own `dayX.js` file, and it will output the result for part 1 and part 2 of the day's challenge.
